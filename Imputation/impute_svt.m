%{
 if n1 and n2 are very different, then
   tau should probably be bigger than 5*sqrt(n1*n2)

 increase tau to increase accuracy; decrease it for speed

 if the algorithm doesn't work well, try changing tau and delta
   i.e. if it diverges, try a smaller delta (e.g. delta < 2 is a 
   safe choice, but the algorithm may be slower than necessary).
